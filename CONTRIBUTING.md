## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Miscord. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out [the required template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Check the [FAQ](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/) and try changing log level.** You might be able to find the cause of the problem and fix things yourself. Most importantly, check if you can reproduce the problem [in the latest version of Miscord](https://github.com/miscord/miscord/wiki/Updating).
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/miscord/miscord/issues)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). You can create an issue in the [miscord](https://github.com/miscord/miscord/issues) repository and provide the following information by filling in [the template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started Miscord, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started Miscord otherwise. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut or an Miscord command, and if so which one?
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **If you're reporting that Miscord crashed**, include a crash report with a stack trace from the operating system. Log file should be in folder `logs/` alongside your config. Include the crash report in the issue in a [code block](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines), a [file attachment](https://help.github.com/articles/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests/), or put it in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) and provide link to that gist.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of Miscord) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of Miscord?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? You can download older versions of Miscord from [the releases page](https://github.com/miscord/miscord/releases) or with `npm install -g miscord@version`.
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of Miscord are you using?** You can get the exact version by running `miscord -v` in your terminal, or by checking the Discord bot's Presence.
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**
* **Which version of NPM you're using (ignore for binary)**

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Miscord, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion). Fill in [the template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md), including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

* **Check the [beta version](https://github.com/miscord/miscord/wiki/Beta-version)** â€” you might discover that the enhancement is already available. Most importantly, check if you're using [the latest version of Miscord](https://github.com/miscord/miscord/wiki/Updating).
* **Check if there's already [a package](https://atom.io/packages) which provides that enhancement.**
* **Determine [which repository the enhancement should be suggested in](#atom-and-packages).**
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/search?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). You can create an issue in the [miscord](https://github.com/miscord/miscord/issues) repository and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Miscord users.
* **Specify which version of Miscord you're using.** You can get the exact version by running `miscord -v` in your terminal, or by checking the Discord bot's Presence.
* **Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.**

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Miscord? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues][beginner] - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues][help-wanted] - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by activity.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain Miscord's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible Miscord
- Enable a sustainable system for Miscord's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details>

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
